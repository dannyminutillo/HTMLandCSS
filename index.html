		<p class="text-law">After I finished playing soccer and graduated from college, I attended law school at the University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law. I made the Dean's List my second year and earned two academic scholarships throughout my time at McGeorge. After I graduated law school, I took the CA Bar exam and passed my first time. I now have my license to practice law in CA.</p>

		<p class="text-companies">After I took the bar exam, I worked on an app with three Stanford Phd students. The app used computer vision to recognize clothing and identified where users could purchase the identified clothing. The beta version was inaccurate, so we stopped production. I then founded an eCommerce company in LA. The company was costing more to operate, than the revenue that was being generated, so production was stopped on that as well. I have a few more ideas in the works and WILL create a successful company.</p>
